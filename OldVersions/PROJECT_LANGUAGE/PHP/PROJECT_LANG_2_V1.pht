// I decided to make PHP the second project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive/Images/Software/Steam) as PHP appears to be one of the languages used with the Steam software client, due to its appearance in search queries. It fits to include it here, as this project is about the Steam software client. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
