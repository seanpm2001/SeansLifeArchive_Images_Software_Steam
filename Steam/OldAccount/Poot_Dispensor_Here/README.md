This was my original steam account. I thought the name was good, but didn't realize until after creation that I misspelled dispenser. I lost access to this account, and had to create a new account on 2022, November 8th. This account only had 3 installations on it: Team Fortress 2 (with ~11-15 hours of playtime, no achievements unlocked) and the Portal 1, Portal 2 soundtracks. Not much of value.
