// About:
// I decided to make C++ the first project language file for this project (seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_Software_Steam) as C++ is one of the languages that the Steam software client is written in. It is unknown what other languages are in use, other than PHP, due to the program being closed source. This project is about the Steam software client, so it makes sense to use C++ to represent this. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
